                                <p>Cointelegraph Magazine is a new publication that goes beyond the daily news and delves much more deeply into the stories, trends, and personalities that inspire cryptocurrency and blockchain conversations around the world.</p>
                                <p>People make the products that shape our lives. Mark Zuckerberg may be a hero or a villain, and he may be both — which is why we seek to understand Zuck when we try to decipher what Facebook adds to (or takes from) our lives.</p>
                                <p>Cointelegraph Magazine is people-centric, delving into *why* the true believers of blockchain feel they can change the world (and why they think it needs to be changed).</p>
                                <p>And equally importantly, it will illustrate how the implementation of this technology is affecting the lives of countless people — today, right now, not at some distant point in the future.</p>
                                <p>It adds context and history to topics that seem arcane: for instance, making the key concepts behind decentralized finance (DeFi) accessible and comprehensible to many more people.</p>
                                <p>It also employs Cointelegraph’s considerable design and development talent pool to create more immersive experiences for the reader, when a data visualization may be worth a thousand words.</p>
                                <p>Cointelegraph Magazine explores this industry through long-form features, thoughtful analysis, and a little humor and satire.</p>
                                <p>It’s a more leisurely approach to this rapid-fire business, combining a rewarding read with an opportunity to learn much more about cryptocurrency — and the various ways blockchain technology is contributing to the world.</p>
                                <p>We hope you enjoy it.</p>
